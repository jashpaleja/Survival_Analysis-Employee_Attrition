# Survival Analysis on Employee Attrition

This repository contains a data science project on Survival Analysis applied to employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics dataset. The analysis is presented in a Jupyter Notebook (`survival_analaysis_on_employee_attrition.ipynb`), providing insights into the factors influencing employee attrition and predicting the survival time of employees within the company.

## Files

### 1. survival_analaysis_on_employee_attrition.ipynb
- The main Jupyter Notebook containing the entire project analysis.
- Divided into sections for clear organization, including preprocessing, Kaplan Meier Survival Curve, Log-Rank test, and Cox Proportional Hazard Model.
- Utilizes various Python libraries and techniques for survival analysis, feature significance, and visualization.

### 2. data_details.py
- A Python script containing details about some categorical columns with numerical values in the dataset.
- Provides additional information to enhance the understanding of specific data features.

### 3. WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv
- The dataset in CSV format sourced from Kaggle (link provided in the notebook).
- Used for conducting survival analysis on employee attrition.
